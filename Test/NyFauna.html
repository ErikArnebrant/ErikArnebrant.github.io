                        <p>
                            The Crabsquid is a large, aggressive life form belonging to the fauna category. It can be found in the Northern Blood Kelp Zone, the Deep Grand Reef and the Lost River.
                        </p>

                            The Crabsquid is a large, aggressive life form belonging to the fauna category. It can be found in the Northern Blood Kelp Zone, the Deep Grand Reef and the Lost River.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Crabsquid's head consists of four large blue eyes and an oddly shaped mandible below them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Crabsquid's lower body resembles that of a Japanese spider/horseshoe crab. Its ten limbs are brown-colored and smooth. Some of them have pointed tips, others have fins, and the two shortest ones near its mouth form a pair of comparably small pincers.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Behavior
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The Crabsquid swims aimlessly around on its own or moves slowly on the seabed with its limbs. Upon being approached, the creature will launch an attack, removing 40% of the player's healthbar. It can also be observed catching and eating smaller fauna.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similar to the Boneshark, the Crabsquid is attracted to light and will follow certain light sources, meaning that it can be distracted using lights from the Cyclops, Seamoth, or Flares. However, using a vehicle's light will usually end up with the Crabsquid disabling it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Crabsquid attacks light sources. If light is shone at a Crabsquid they will retaliate with an EMP blast, temporarily disabling electronics, vehicles and Seabase power. This makes it highly illogical to build near an area inhabited by Crabsquids.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the player approaches the Crabsquid in the Seamoth within its line of sight, the creature will chase the submersible a short distance and attack, dealing 20% damage to the vehicle's health.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Crabsquid frequently emits loud, echoing clicks for the purpose of echolocation.

                            The Stalker is an aggressive life form belonging to the fauna category. Most of them populate the Kelp Forest, while it can also be found around the Aurora in the Crash Zone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Occasionally, Stalkers can be found swimming into the Safe Shallows while chasing Peepers or other small fauna.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Stalker is a rather large creature, possessing an elongated, fusiform body with smooth skin. Its head features a long snout greatly resembling that of real life crocodiles, alligators, gharials and gars of the genus atractosteus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On its back protrude seven dorsal plates running along from neck to tail, as well as two pectoral and pelvic, purple-tipped fins on each side, and ends with a broad, fluked tail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Stalker's dorsal side is blue-gray in color and patterned in dark blue and purple, with a bright green and aqua underside.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Stalker seems to have a fondness for a metal; it will approach the metal objects such as Metal Salvage, Silver Ore and Titanium pick it up with its mouth and start flailing it around for a while. Doing so will not only displace the item, but will sometimes leave behind a Stalker Tooth. Stalker teeth will also sometimes drop when a Stalker attempts to attack a Seamoth, or grabs a Camera Drone. These teeth are required for creating Enameled Glass, which is needed to make a Cyclops and other useful items. Stalkers will sometimes place metal salvage in a certain area with other pieces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             Being predators, Stalkers will attempt to chase and eat nearby Peepers and other small prey. They will also attack the player upon close encounters, with each bite dealing 30 damage. The player should be cautious while exploring Kelp Forests to avoid getting attacked by surprise, as Stalkers often form small groups that will lurk in the dense Creepvines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At night, beside being more difficult to spot due to being one of only two non-bioluminescent creatures in the game, Stalkers become more aggressive and have a wider aggressive radius, so it is advised to avoid swimming near Kelp Forests at night without adequate protection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stalkers can be found guarding or lurking near their eggs, and will attack if the player gets too close.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stalkers can grab Camera Drones, including ones housed in their sockets on the Scanner Room and will carry them in their mouth similarly to Metal Salvage. During this time the drones are incapacitated and can be taken out of their maximum range, rendering them unusable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stalkers will also collect ores, should the player drop it near them.

                            The Reaper Leviathan is a huge aggressive life form belonging to the fauna category. It is currently the second largest carnivore in the game. Overall, it is the third largest life form in Subnautica, behind the Reefback and the Sea Dragon Leviathan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Several Reaper Leviathans reside near the Aurora, guarding the area. However, it mainly dwells in vast, open biomes like the Dunes and the Mountains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Inactive Lava Zone, multiple Reaper Leviathan skeletons can be found. This is due to Sea Dragon Leviathans coming up from the lava zone to catch them, then dragging them down to the lava zone to feast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Reaper Leviathan is a colossal creature. If fins and head protrusions are included, the creature is just a little shorter than a Cyclops submarine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Reaper Leviathan possesses a long, slim, muscularly built body with four caudal fins and two pectoral fins. It also has two dorsal fins running along the length of its entire body, and two ventral fins taking a small portion of its belly. Most of its fins, along with its back, are red in color.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Its head features a large mouth, as well as two pairs of green eyes along with large red, black tipped mandibles on each side. Most of the body is blue-shaded white in color, having seemingly smooth skin.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Reaper Leviathan usually emits loud, echoing roars audible from great distances. According to the data bank entry, this roar is a form of echolocation, though the roar does not function like this in game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It also seems to circle its prey (or more commonly the player) for a few moments before attacking, and often strikes from behind by surprise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the Reaper Leviathan manages to grab the Player, the creature will hold its victim in its mandibles, pause for a second while roaring, and then proceed to pull the player into its mouth, killing them instantly.

                        <p>
                            The Bladderfish is a passive life form belonging to the fauna category. It is catchable and edible, mostly populating in the Safe Shallows and the Grand Reef. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Bladderfish stands out in comparison to other small fishes, as they can be used to craft Filtered Water. As a result, Bladderfish are a good source of H₂O, though behind Disinfected Water and Large Filtered Water.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Being slow and passive, Bladderfish are easy to catch, especially during night time, when they are next to immobile due to their diurnal properties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Eating a raw Bladderfish will restore 15 oxygen, which can save the player in certain situations. This only works in survival mode.

They have two small pectoral fins and one long dorsal fin that extends across its tail protuding from the back of its triangular head. Next to its side fins, two tendrils extend towards the tail, to which they connect about mid-way.

                        <p>
                            Spadefish have a broad, yet low, mouth lined with small white teeth at the front, on top of which lies a single large eye with a black pupil that is split into two halves. A small concave black stripe goes up from the tip of its mouth.

                            The Spadefish's body is predominantly turqoise in color with a few lighter patches dotted around. A ring of reddish-pink skin encircles the eye and it has bright bright orange fins. The patches, fins and the area around the eye emit bioluminescent glows at night.

                           Floaters can be found in Safe Shallows and Grassy Plateaus. They are catchable and can be attached to items and props, but not all of them will provide buoyancy after attachment. There are two types of Floaters: smalls and giants. The small Floaters are the kinds that can be held in the players hands, and can be attached to items. Giant Floaters on the other hand, are found underneath the Floating Island and Underwater Islands. They are huge relatives of the small, portable Floaters, and hold up the latter and the former. Giant Floaters are uninteractable. Their life cycle is unknown.

                            Floaters can be used to move rocks that occasionally block cave entrances.

                            They will at times attempt to attach themselves to the player. This will result in the player's 10% health loss and the Floater's death.

                        <p>
                            Floaters distinguish themselves by their transparent, gelatinous, blue-colored surface and a pink core, or body. The life forms have strange bumps on their blue masses with five small, white circles in the center. They have multiple small tentacle-like arms near a mouth with which they attach themselves to objects.
