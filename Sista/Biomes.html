            <h1>
                <u>Safe Shallows</u>
            </h1>
            <p>
            The Safe Shallows is the first biome encountered by the player. It is where Lifepod 5 crash-landed. This is also the starting point of the game, located to the west of the Aurora, towards the center of the map. 
		  </p>
            <p>
            The Safe Shallows contains coral reefs sprawling over a large part of the area, with small cave systems that can be found beneath. As the name implies, this biome is one of the safest in the game, as it is a relatively shallow area, there are few environmental hazards and no predators call this biome home. However, caution should still be taken for the occasional Gasopods passing through, and the caves are frequently home to hostile Crashfish. Stalkers may also wander into the biome, though they will never go very far from the Kelp Forests. The same applies for Sand Sharks which will wander away from the Grassy Plateaus.

            The Safe Shallows offers plentiful diving experiences for all players, especially newcomers, as it is home to a variety of life forms; corals, fauna (mostly edible), and flora alike, with a great abundance of harvestable materials.

            <h1>
                <u>Crag field</u>
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Crag Field is a rocky biome dominated by large geological crag formations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Crag Field is situated between the Grand Reef, the Crash Zone, Kelp Forest, and shares its border with one of the Grassy Plateaus. It is situated south of the Aurora's engines. It features large rock spikes and rippling rock hills, bearing resemblance to the older Grand Reef, with all of which being formed on top a massive crag dropping down into the aforementioned biome.

                The Crag Field is a resource-rich biome with some low-level predators. Groups of Boneshark are frequent in the area, along with the occasional Mesmer passing by. Tiger Plants can also be found in this biome, camouflaged and mostly hidden in the grasses within the rock structures. The biome also features a grand abundance of minerals and other resources.

                A few pods of Reefbacks can be located drifting in the water above the Crag Field.

        <h1>
        <u>The Blood Kelp Zone</u>
        </h1>
        <p>
        The Blood Kelp Zones are special biomes in Subnautica, characterized by a variety of giant Bloodvines, some of which carry Blood Oil pustules down near their stem.

The Blood Kelp Trench is located south-west from Lifepod 5, between the Dunes, the Sparse Reef, the Grassy Plateaus and the Sea Treader's Path. A cave opening that leads directly into the Lost River Precursor Cache can be found in this biome.

The Trench lacks the Crabsquids of the Northern Blood Kelp Zone, but still has predators in the form of Blighters and Warpers. The more confined spaces may make it more difficult to avoid them if one is not careful.

It consists of a single deep trench with natural rock bridges spanning from one wall to another, and a small cavern system located below the Bloodvines where their roots can be found. One of the Wrecks can be found in this area, stuck between the trench's walls. This zone is nearly impossible to explore with the Cyclops due to the trench's narrow width.

        </div>
        <div id="koosh">
        <h1>
        <u>Koosh Zone</u>
        </h1>
        <p>
        The Koosh Zone is a unique type of biome bordering one of the Mushroom Forests, the Crash Zone, the Mountains, and the Void.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Koosh Zone is characterized by small crevices and overhangs in a sandy dune-like area. It is also abundant with small brown algae and a large variety of plants with blueish purple hues, the most notable of which being the Koosh Bush.

The Koosh Zone is home to certain dangerous fauna. Notable predators, such as Bonesharks and Ampeels, can be found scattered throughout the Koosh Zone. Mesmers can also be found to a lesser degree.

Due to its proximity to the Crash Zone, the southern half of the Koosh Zone is subject to radiation. If the player has not repaired the Aurora's drive room, a Radiation Suit is needed to explore the southern region.

There is a cave system located below the Koosh Zone, known as the Koosh Zone Caves. These caves are accessible via any of the three entrances located within the biome. One of the caves links to the Mushroom Forest Caves.

Several Lava Geysers can be found in this biome. This, together with the Koosh Zone Caves, suggests a small amount of volcanic activity in the Koosh Zone.

Wreck 3 is located within the Koosh Zone, containing several fragments.

        <div id="kelp">
        <h1>
        <u>Kelp Forest</u>
        </h1>
        <p>
        The Kelp Forest is one of the most diverse Biomes because of the range of Fauna and Flora inhabiting it. It is characterized by the abundance of Creepvines, and possesses a distinct greenish hue in the water.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Kelp Forest is one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Planet 4546B. It is also the primary home of Stalkers.

It is located at medium-shallow depths, and is home to many passive life forms, with the exception of Stalkers, Bleeders, and Drooping Stingers. The seabed is mostly mossy and sandy, with the terrain being comprised of grassy knolls and arches, sometimes showing entrances to small cavern systems. There are many canyons to be found in these forests.

Most of the raw materials found here are at medium-level depths, with many harvesting nodes such as Limestone and Sandstone. The Creepvine seed clusters, found on some Creepvines, not only provide light and beautiful night time scenery, but are also crucial ingredients for making lubricant and silicone rubber.

There are currently five Kelp Forests on the map, some containing wrecks or destroyed lifepods, or even both.

A lot of metal salvage can be found here due to the Stalkers' gathering behavior.

        <div id="grand">
        <h1>
        <u>Grand Reef</u>
        </h1>
        <p>
        The Grand Reef is a unique deep biome in Subnautica that covers the southwestern portion of the map.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Grand Reef is home to many types of fauna, including the large herbivorous Sea Treader. It is also known for its unique types of flora, from the luminous Floating Stones to the peculiar Membrain Trees. It features its own cave system, the Grand Reef Caves.

Below this area, the player can find a large cavern system featuring the similar types of flora and fauna, with the addition of Crabsquids and Jellyrays and the absence of the Sea Treader. Above the Grand Reef, is the Floating Island.

Commonly found harvesting nodes in the Grand Reef are basalt outcrops, as well as many other type of rare crystals.

Scattered deep within the Grand Reef are hydrothermal vents, five in total.
